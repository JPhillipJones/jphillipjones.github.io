Jeremy is an old OPS guy from the dark ages of computing.  He started automating NT 4.0 installations and hasn't looked back.  Classically trained as an Active Directory Administrator and Windows Engineer, he is currently engrossed in all things Powershell and is eagerly awaiting the death of the GUI.
