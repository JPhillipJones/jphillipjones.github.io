title: Non-Technical Issues
---

When I was just starting my career as a developer, I was often found myself stressing over the technical aspects of software development tasks, wondering if I would be able to come up with a solution to the problem at hand.  As someone who lacked experience, I worried that I would end up with a business requirement that I just wouldn't know how to meet.  As I gained experience and matured into a full stack developer, I began to realize that these fears were largely unfounded.  For any given technical requirement, there was always some solution I develop, or often as not, find someone else who had already had developed a soluiton for a similar requirement.  For things technical now, my primary concern is making sure I choose the best aproach among many to get the job done.

However, in recent years and incresingly so, I end up with the delima of non-techinal problems.  These are primarily problems of communication, responsibility, and bussiness process(or lack there of).  Often times I've found myself writing the code to facilitate a particular business process, only to find out that the business process has changed, the person or persons responsible have moved on, or someone decided an off the shelf solution would be sufficient(which is almost never the case).
